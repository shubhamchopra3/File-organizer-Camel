# File-organizer-Camel

* In this post i am gonna show how to shift all your files from Downloads folder to respective folder, by using a simple Apache Camel route.

* Apache Camel is a rule-based routing and mediation engine that provides a Java object-based implementation of the Enterprise Integration Patterns using an API (or declarative Java Domain Specific Language) to configure routing and mediation rules.

Install the maven dependencies and update the maven project then run the ``` SpringBootMain.java ``` and you will see all your files are sorted.
